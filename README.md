# Travel Ticket Cancellation Prediction 🌍🎫🔮
Welcome to the Travel Ticket Cancellation Prediction project! This repository focuses on predicting travel ticket cancellations using machine learning techniques. The dataset has been preprocessed, features engineered, and models built to provide insights into customer behavior regarding ticket cancellations and risk management.

## Dataset 📊
The dataset contains information related to travel bookings, including customer details, trip duration, and other relevant features. It has been cleaned and processed to ensure suitability for predictive modeling.

## Feature Engineering 🔧
Several features have been engineered to capture meaningful information from the raw dataset. This process involves transforming existing features and creating new ones to improve the predictive power of the models.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📈
EDA has been performed to gain insights into the underlying patterns and relationships within the dataset. Visualizations and statistical summaries have been utilized to understand the distribution of features and identify potential correlations.

## Model Building 🛠️
Multiple machine learning models have been constructed to predict travel ticket cancellations. Various algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest have been implemented and evaluated.

## ML Ops Integration 🚀
This project integrates ML Ops tools to streamline model development and deployment processes.

### MLflow 📊
MLflow has been utilized for continuous tracking of model performance and metrics. Experiment tracking and model versioning have been managed using MLflow's capabilities. Charts generated by MLflow have facilitated the identification of the best-performing model and its associated hyperparameters.

### Prefect ⚙️
Prefect, another ML Ops tool, has been incorporated for continued model training. Prefect enables automated workflows for scheduling and orchestrating model training processes, ensuring that models are regularly updated with new data.

## Streamlit Application 🌐
An interactive Streamlit application has been developed to provide users with a user-friendly interface for making predictions using the trained models.
